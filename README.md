# FIFO
Verification of a FIFO
The "FIFO Basic Operation" test case is designed to verify the fundamental functionality of a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) memory. The test steps cover initialization, data writing, verification of data writing order, data reading, verification of data reading order, and testing boundary conditions such as overflow and underflow scenarios. This comprehensive test case helps ensure that the FIFO memory correctly stores and retrieves data in a first-in, first-out manner, adhering to its specified behavior and capacity constraints.
